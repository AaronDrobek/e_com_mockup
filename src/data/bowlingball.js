    description: "The new Quantum Forest Green Solid has been designed with 3.5 times more coverstock increasing durability and performance longevity with an amazing pin impact you not only see but hear! Why does more coverstock improve the pin action so much? More coverstock enhances the Coefficient of Restitution which is the ratio of the differences in velocity between two objects before and after a collision. The higher the restitution, the faster the pins will move after being struck by the ball, transferring that increased kinetic energy to the surrounding pins producing greater pin action!",

    description: "The original Burgundy Hammer from the early 1990's was the earliest and strongest ball of its time; if you needed hook, you turned to the Burgundy. We didn’t set out to give the bowling world another urethane product, we already have the Blue Hammer and you wouldn’t see a lot of difference on today’s lane conditions. Instead, we have brought you the Burgundy Hammer reaction for today's environments. ",

Never has a ball from DV8 created the kind of traction in oil that you'll see from the Pitbull. The DV8 Pitball is a baller's best friend.",
